# Web Development Resources
These resources have been gathered to help get students up-to-speed on web development.

## Nick's Webdev Crash Course
0. [Introduction to Visual Hierarchies](https://www.loom.com/share/452842c71c5448fcb6a56dac9d68be15?t=0)

Throughout the rest of the series, the [codepen that I'm working through](https://codepen.io/nicholaszufelt/pen/GRprZZZ) as I make these videos might be a helpful resource, as well.

1. [HTML and CSS Intro](https://www.loom.com/share/ff9641b3786f4bab90bcc2dc74107f40?t=0)
2. [Shaping some content](https://www.loom.com/share/16e4dd03dbaa425e965bf389b208ea80?t=0)
3. [Links](https://www.loom.com/share/306bdb5b185a47d38a43b1dea96d9e8e)
4. [The Box Model](https://www.loom.com/share/c2a45865868a48e6a6cb3af6f5e15ea6?t=0)
5. **Web Design**. One challenge you're probably having throughout watching my above videos is a feeling of "yeah, okay, maybe I'm starting to understand how to do this, but I don't know what to do to make it look good!" What you're describing is the difference between web development (coding a website) and web design (caring about the user experience and making things visually appealing). The world of web design is vast and at times intractable to those who haven't messed around too much with it before. Here are a few resources to get you started â€” you don't necessarily have to work through all of them, but if you find yourself still frustrated with "but everything looks bad!" then you can return to these resources for more inspiration.
    * [Web design in 4 minutes](https://jgthms.com/web-design-in-4-minutes/): This website starts off with no CSS, and then slowly adds more, and with each revision makes things look dramatically better. I highly recommend a full read.
    * [Design for non-designers](https://medium.com/hello-web-design/design-for-non-designers-part-1-6559ed93ff91): This blog post covers some basic ideas, again iterating on a design (but this time it's not the whole page
    * [RefactoringUI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6-q5BheEYU): This youtube channel takes submissions of websites and the narrator redesigns them real-time. It's incredible to watch him work, and you might learn a thing or two along the way.
    * [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/): Another reasonable option for beginners is to use a Framework like Bootstrap. This has a little bit of a learning curve, but the basic idea is you add a bunch of CSS classes to your code, tell bootstrap to run on your website, and Poof! Everything looks pretty darn good. Different CSS frameworks are more or less opinionated, as in they lock you into more or less rigid designs, but they all look good enough for a basic website.
6. [Flexbox](https://www.loom.com/share/68a158f8fa944629bea9d35aad000fc6?t=0), with extra resources mentioned in the video:
    * [A Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)
    * [Flexbox Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/): A fun game to learn flexbox!
    * [My Flexbox Codepen](https://codepen.io/nicholaszufelt/pen/VwvPdEa)
    * [Material Design Shadows](https://codepen.io/sdthornton/pen/wBZdXq): a useful resource for making attractive box-shadows

## Main Learning Tools
Each of these websites can answer nearly any web development question you have.  They both have very long tutorials which move quite slowly through the basic concepts.  I recommend clicking around for a few minutes on each site, and then treating them as a definitive reference after you learn the basics.
* [Mozilla Developer's Network (MDN)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn)
* [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)

## Must-do
I think these activities/sites will get you quickly up and running in web development.
1. The _LearnXinYMinutes_ site has some great, quick explanations for people who have experience working with some programming concepts and want to get up-to-speed with others.
    * [HTML](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/html/)
    * [CSS](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/css/)
    * There's also [JavaScript](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/javascript/), but this one isn't as good as the above two...probably because it's such a _much_ larger concept.
1. If at this point you're still feeling a bit confused on the basic ideas of HTML hierarchies and CSS Selectors, read through [this article](https://www.internetingishard.com/html-and-css/).  That website, _InternetingIsHard_, has lots of helpful articles, but they are quite verbose.  If you like their style, look through for some other content!
1. I think the [CSS Box Model](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_boxmodel.asp) is a particularly important thing to understand.  It should help you understand whether you want to change _padding_ or _margin_.
1. Now that you understand basic HTML and CSS, I would argue that understanding CSS flexbox will allow you to layout any design.  This is a three-part process:
    1. [This video](https://youtube.com/watch?v=4GaHn08BXQw) covers the basic concepts.  It's a bit dry (sorry!), but it does the job.
    1. Quickly look over [this site](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/), and bookmark it.  It is a useful reference while designing with flexbox, not a learning tool.
    1. Now, work through the exercises on [flexbox froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/).
    1. If you're still feeling a bit lost on how to incorporate this into an actual website, watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k32voqQhODc), which works through five examples.
1. At this point, just keep making websites!
<!-- * Basic CSS concepts: [Syntax and Selectors](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_syntax.asp) and [how to include it](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_howto.asp). -->

* [Footers that Stay Down](https://codepen.io/nicholaszufelt/pen/VBbRGG): a surprisingly difficult problem.  Also solvable with flexboxes!
* [Transitions](https://codepen.io/nicholaszufelt/pen/bjbavx): Simple smooth animations using just CSS.
* [Hidden Content](https://codepen.io/nicholaszufelt/pen/XBKWjw): Showing and hiding content using JavaScript to create a menu that displays different content when the user clicks on buttons.
* [Adding and Removing Dom Nodes](https://codepen.io/nicholaszufelt/pen/OwRWNb): It is crucial to understand how JavaScript can change the DOM (the Document Object Model, or the in-memory version of the website).

### Specific Tools
These sites are helpful for learning specific tools.

##### Flexbox
(These are the same as above.)
* [Learn Flexbox](https://youtube.com/watch?v=4GaHn08BXQw)
* [Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)
* [Flexbox Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/)
* [Flexbox Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k32voqQhODc): a 30-minute video that works through 5 flexbox examples

##### CSS Grid
* [Mozilla's Tutorial on CSS Grid](https://mozilladevelopers.github.io/playground/css-grid): Mozilla made this to advertise their new CSS Grid inspector in their developer tools, so it's a slightly themed toward that, but it's still an excellent explanation of CSS Grid.
* [CSS Grid Garden](http://cssgridgarden.com/): Like flexbox froggy but for CSS Grid.

### Reading
* [My HTML/CSS/JavaScript basic code style guide](https://github.com/nzufelt/ace10_summer2018/blob/master/webdev_code_style.md).  It doesn't handle much, but it's enough to get you started with styling your code.
* [r/webdev's FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/wiki/faq): "How do I become a web developer?"
* [r/web_design's FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/web_design/wiki/faq): "How do I learn to style websites?"
